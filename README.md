# CS1 TA Guide (Java)

A teaching and reference repository for **CS1-level Java concepts**, combining pseudocode, runnable Java examples, and visual diagrams to help students build strong mental models of programming fundamentals.
This repo reflects how core CS1 concepts were taught and reinforced through **small games, simulations, and interactive programs**.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A structured **learning companion** for introductory Java
- A collection of **original teaching examples** written from a TA perspective
- A bridge between **pseudocode → Java → problem-solving**
- A resource for understanding *how programs work*, not just how to write them

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- ❌ Not a solution key for active or past assignments  
- ❌ Not intended to enable academic dishonesty  
- ❌ Not a replacement for course instruction  

All examples are **original, simplified, and instructional**, and are from my employment at SUNY New Paltz as a TR (Teacher of Record) for Prof. Katherine Brainard's CS1 course (Fall 2025).
Note:  These files were written specifically to pass the Autograder's JUnit tests.  
The .java files have been filtered of advanced syntax (ternary, early returns, use of certain libraries) which were run locally through each cloned assignment on the class repo. 
The Eclipse IDE was required, and students imported the cloned assignments. Once opened, the folder contained boiler plate code, extra files (like JAR) and Prof. Brainard's Autograder (JUnit tests).

## Course Context & Programming Projects

The concepts in this repository are inspired by CS1 coursework that introduced programming through **progressively complex programs**, including:

- **Intro to Binky**  
  Understanding memory, references, and how variables point to objects
- **Hangman**  
  Strings, loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input
- **Tic Tac Toe**  
  2D arrays, game state, logic flow, and method decomposition
- **Checkers (intro-level)**  
  Object modeling, turn-based logic, and structured state
- **Adventure / Text-Based Games**  
  Classes, objects, control flow, and program organization

These projects helped reinforce *why* Java concepts matter, not just *how* to use them.

## Repo Structure:
Each pseudocode document will be in a .md format.  There is a corresponding java file inside the java-examples folder.  I also provided some exercises, and 1 quiz.
